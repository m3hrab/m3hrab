- 👋 Hi, I’m @m3hrab
- 👀 I’m currently interested in Game Development, machine learning, and almost anything cool and new in software and tech.
- 🧠 I know a lot about python based game development, simulation, and how to glue a few Raspberry Pi's together to make a fun project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about LLMs, and machine learning for fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that enables positive social change using new technology.
